# Spammer

### What is Spamming ?
Spamming is the use of messaging system to send an unsolicited message repeatedly on the same website.The person who sents the spamming message is called Spammer.

### Introduction
This is an act of personal revenge on my friend he used to send me texts at an absurd time so I thought it might be some REVENGE TIME.
So you require a Web Driver in my case I have used Chrome so it's easy to guess that I have used Chrome Driver and then it is required to know the location where your driver is placed and provide it to the webdriver Class of the Selenium library and then you are required to input some basic name, message, etc. 

### Basic Program Details
So the program uses basic Selenium library and Time library.
Selenium is used to load the web driver and run it. The driver gets the URL to run in the Web Browser and then performs the given instruction such as writing and clicking with the help of the XPath of every element on the web page using the XML path expression.

XPath is defined as the XML path. XPath is used to find the location of any element on a webpage using HTML DOM structure.
There are two types of XPath Absolute and Relative XPath.
In the given program I have used Absolute XPath which is the direct way to find the element. The key characteristic of XPath is that it begins with the single forward-slash(/), which means you can select the element from the root node.

You can see that there is sleep() function now and then which is just to make the program sleep so that your webpage can load which basically depends on your network speed. The sleep() function takes an argument in seconds. For example sleep(5) means that the program will sleep for 5 seconds whenever it is triggered.

**Whatsapp Spammer** : So the program recquires you to enter the name of the receipant , the text message you want to flood your friends Message Box with and the number of messages you want to send him let say 1000 or 5000 or as much as you like. You will have to manually authenticate your whatsapp once when the Web Browser starts.

**Telegram Spammer** : This program will recquire you to enter your Country you recide in and your phone number after that you'll have to manually enter your verification code as a process of authentication and then enter the name of the person and the message you want to spam with and the number od message you want to send to that person.
